# Ember-minesweeper

This is an example of how to build [Minesweeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper) using [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com).

A working demo can be played at [https://ember-minesweeper.herokuapp.com](https://ember-minesweeper.herokuapp.com)

This app is built using the open source projects/packages. Check them out if you're interested in learning more:

* [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)
* [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/)
* [Bootstrap3](http://www.getbootstrap.com)
* [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.com)
* [CoffeeScript](http://www.coffeescript.org)

### How to play

The goal of the game is to uncover all the squares that do not contain mines without being "blown up" by clicking on a square with a mine underneath. The location of the mines is discovered by a process of logic. You can also flag squares that you suspect contain mines by `right+click`.
